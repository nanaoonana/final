                <ul>

                <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <section>

Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy (if applicable, or can be detailed here).</p>
                <p>For this demo application, we primarily use localStorage for application functionality, which stores data directly in your browser and is not a tracking cookie in the traditional sense. We do not currently use third-party tracking cookies for advertising purposes.</p>

If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
